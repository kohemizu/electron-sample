> Vite + Electron + Svelte = 🔥🔥🔥

This is a Svelte specific fork of a secure template for electron applications. Written following the latest safety requirements, recommendations and best practices.

Under the hood is used [Vite] — super fast, nextgen bundler, and [electron-builder] for compilation.

## Get started

Follow these steps to get started with this template:

1. Click the **[Use this template](https://github.com/HermanLederer/vite-electron-builder-svelte/generate)** button (you must be logged in) or just clone this repo.
2. If you want use another package manager don't forget edit [`.github/workflows`](/.github/workflows) -- it uses `npm` by default.

That's all you need. 😉

**Note**: This template uses npm v7 feature — [**Installing Peer Dependencies Automatically**](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/latest/implemented/0025-install-peer-deps.md). If you are using a different package manager, you may need to install some peerDependencies manually.

## Features

### Electron [![Electron version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/HermanLederer/vite-electron-builder-svelte/dev/electron?label=%20)][electron]

- Template use the latest electron version with all the latest security patches.
- The architecture of the application is built according to the security [guides](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security) and best practices.
- The latest version of the [electron-builder] is used to compile the application.

### Vite [![Vite version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/HermanLederer/vite-electron-builder-svelte/dev/vite?label=%20)][vite]

- [Vite] is used to bundle all source codes. This is an extremely fast packer that has a bunch of great features. You can learn more about how it is arranged in [this](https://youtu.be/xXrhg26VCSc) video.
- Vite [supports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) reading `.env` files. You can also specify types of your environment variables in [`types/vite-env.d.ts`](types/vite-env.d.ts).
- Hot reloads for `Main` and `Renderer` processes.

Vite provides you with many useful features, such as: `TypeScript`, `TSX/JSX`, `CSS/JSON Importing`, `CSS Modules`, `Web Assembly` and much more.

[See all Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html).

### TypeScript [![TypeScript version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/HermanLederer/vite-electron-builder-svelte/dev/typescript?label=%20)][typescript]

- The Latest TypeScript is used for all source code.
- **Vite** supports TypeScript out of the box. However, it does not support type checking.
- Code formatting rules follow the latest TypeScript recommendations and best practices thanks to [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin).

**This fork does not support the removal of Typescript. Why would you?**

### Svelte [![Svelte version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/dependency-version/HermanLederer/vite-electron-builder-svelte/svelte?label=%20)][svelte]

- Web pages are built using [Svelte]. If you would like to use a different framework I recommend basing it on the [original repo](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder).
- Code formatting rules follow the latest Svelte recommendations and best practices thanks to [eslint-plugin-svelte].

### Continuous Integration

- The configured workflow for check the types for each push and PR.
- The configured workflow for check the code style for each push and PR.
- **Automatic tests** used [playwright]. Simple, automated test check:
  - Does the main window created and visible?
  - Is the main window not empty?
  - Is dev tools closed?
  - Is preload script loaded?

### Continuous delivery

- Each time you push changes to the `main` branch, [`release`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow starts, which creates release draft.
  - The version is automatically set based on the current date in the format `yy.mm.dd-minutes`.
  - Notes are automatically generated and added to the release draft.
  - Code signing supported. See [`compile` job in `release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).
- **Auto-update is supported**. After the release will be published, all client applications will download the new version and install updates silently.

## Status

The origianl template was created to make the [original author's][cawa-93-github] work easier but they are trying to keep in universal with Vue as the default framework. This fork replaces it with Svelte.

[Me][hermanlederer-github] and the [original author][cawa-93-github] are actively involved in its development. But we do not guarantee that this template will be maintained in the future.

**At the moment, there are the following problems:**

- ⚠ Playwright has [**experimental** support for Electron](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron/).
- ⚠ Release notes are created automatically based on commit history. [`.github/actions/release-notes`](.github/actions/release-notes) is used for generation. It may not provide some scenarios. If you encounter a problem - write about it.
- ⏳ The [original author][cawa-93-github] wants to migrate all code base to ESM. But because Nodejs ecosystem is unprepared he has not known whether this will give more benefits or more inconvenience.

Some improvement or problems can be listed in [issues of the original repo](https://github.com/cawa-93/vite-electron-builder/issues).

**Pull requests are welcome**.

## How it works

The template required a minimum [dependencies](package.json). Only **Vite** is used for building, nothing more.

### Project Structure

The structure of this template is very similar to the structure of a monorepo.

The entire source code of the program is divided into three modules (packages) that are bundled each independently:

- [`packages/main`](packages/main)
  Electron [**main script**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-the-main-script-file).
- [`packages/preload`](packages/preload)
  Used in `BrowserWindow.webPreferences.preload`. See [Checklist: Security Recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content).
- [`packages/renderer`](packages/renderer)
  Electron [**web page**](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#create-a-web-page).

### Build web resources

Packages `main` and `preload` are built in [library mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode) as it is a simple javascript.
`renderer` package build as regular web app.

The build of web resources is performed in the [`scripts/build.js`](scripts/build.js). Its analogue is a sequential call to `vite build` for each package.

### Compile App

Next step is run packaging and compilation a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux with "auto update" support out of the box.

To do this, using the [electron-builder]:

- In npm script `compile`: This script is configured to compile the application as quickly as possible. It is not ready for distribution, is compiled only for the current platform and is used for debugging.
- In GitHub Action: The application is compiled for any platform and ready-to-distribute files are automatically added to the draft GitHub release.

### Using Node.js API in renderer

According to [Electron's security guidelines](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security#2-do-not-enable-nodejs-integration-for-remote-content), Node.js integration is disabled for remote content. This means that **you cannot call any Node.js api in the `packages/renderer` directly**. To do this, you **must** describe the interface in the `packages/preload` where Node.js api is allowed:

```ts
// packages/preload/src/index.ts
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

const api = {
  readConfig: () => readFile("/path/to/config.json", { encoding: "utf-8" }),
};

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electron", api);
```

```ts
// packages/renderer/src/App.svelte
import { useElectron } from "/@/use/electron";

const { readConfig } = useElectron();
```

[Read more about Security Considerations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation#security-considerations).

### Modes and Environment Variables

All environment variables set as part of the `import.meta`, so you can access them as follows: `import.meta.env`.

You can also specify types of your environment variables in [`types/vite-env.d.ts`](types/vite-env.d.ts).

The mode option is used to specify the value of `import.meta.env.MODE` and the corresponding environment variables files that needs to be loaded.

By default, there are two modes:

- `production` is used by default
- `development` is used by `npm run watch` script

When running building, environment variables are loaded from the following files in your project root:

```
.env                # loaded in all cases
.env.local          # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]         # only loaded in specified env mode
.env.[mode].local   # only loaded in specified env mode, ignored by git
```

**Note:** only variables prefixed with `VITE_` are exposed to your code (e.g. `VITE_SOME_KEY=123`) and `SOME_KEY=123` will not. You can access `VITE_SOME_KEY` using `import.meta.env.VITE_SOME_KEY`. This is because the `.env` files may be used by some users for server-side or build scripts and may contain sensitive information that should not be exposed in code shipped to browsers.
